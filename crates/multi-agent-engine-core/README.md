# Multi-Agent Engine Core

The CPU-based core simulation engine for the Multi-Agent Engine library.

## Overview

`multi-agent-engine-core` provides the foundational CPU execution layer for multi-agent simulations.
It implements the dual-thread architecture that separates simulation logic from user interaction, enabling lock-free, concurrent execution at independent frequencies.
