# Multi-Agent Engine GPU

GPU acceleration support for the Multi-Agent Engine library.

## Overview

`multi-agent-engine-gpu` extends the core simulation engine with GPU computation capabilities, enabling massive parallelization of agent behaviors and physics calculations.
It provides a hybrid CPU/GPU execution pipeline where individual layers and agent computations can be selectively offloaded to the GPU.
